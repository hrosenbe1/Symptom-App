# Symptom Log

## Overview:

Symptom Log helps users keep track of medical symptoms they may have experienced. Most people don't tell their doctors everything because they may be embarrassed or they may forget what has happened since they last saw their doctor. It is very important to keep an accurate log so your doctor can diagnose you with any problems and treat you to the best of their ability. Symptom Log helps you keep everything in one place securely and accurately.

## Project Notes:

I chose to create Symptom Log as my first Ruby on Rails app. I think it is a great concept and a great implementation of the language. I have two models, the User, and Symptoms. The user has many symptoms and symptoms have one user. Each user must sign up and create an account. The app is password secure to keep all medical information private. I have complete RESTful routes for the symptoms model with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. 

##Technologies Used:

- Languages - HTML5, CSS3, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL 
- Project Planning & User Stories - [Trello](https://trello.com/b/tmtWzxK0/full-stack-app)

##Bonus Features:

- Each user may upload a picture with each symptom
- Styled with Bootstrap/SASS and Bootswatch
- Embedded WebMD real time Twitter feed

##Future Developments:

- Make the app responsive
- Work on CSS on form, show, and index pages
